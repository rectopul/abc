=== How To SVI works and Setup ===

[youtube https://youtu.be/QMV8XBeub_o]

Smart Variations Images is packed with the essential features to optimise your WooCommerce product image gallery and boost your sales.

By default WooCommerce will only swap the main variation image when you select a product variation, not the gallery images below it.

This extension allows visitors to your online store to be able to swap different gallery images when they select a product variation.
Adding this feature will let visitors see different images of a product variation all in the same color and style.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `smart-variations-images` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

5. Save the product
6. Good luck with sales :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with any Theme? =

Yes! Themes that follow the default WooCommerce implementation will usually work with this plugin. However, some themes use an unorthodox method to add their own lightbox/slider, which breaks the hooks this plugin needs.
SVI was tested with the mos popular themes like OceanWP / Astra / Flatsome / Avada / Storefront / WR Nitro / Divi / BeTheme / Zerif Lite / Hestia / Shopisle and more.

= Does it support page builders?  =

SVI is not compatible with custom product pages built with Builders (ex: Visual Composer, UX, Builder, Unyson, etc.), these Builders completely take over the design and hooks of the pages running them, so if a builder is applied to a product page SVI will not be accessible.

Although if you need it, I can probably figure something out!

= How do I configure it to work? =

1. Create a product and build it's attributes & variations
2. Go to "SVI Variations Gallery" tab and setup the galleries according to the variations you want displayed
3. Save the product
4. Go to WooCommerce > SVI > Global TAB and "Enable SVI" so that is works on the Front-End
5. Good luck with sales :)
6. What the video if have doubts (https://youtu.be/QMV8XBeub_o)

= What Browsers does SVI support =

SVI doesn’t support IE since is no longer maintained by Microsoft since at least 2015. and it doesn’t support ecmascript. [READ MORE](microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-ie-support)

SVI is tested to run on:
– Microsoft EDGE
– Safari
– Chrome
– Firefox

= What happens to my theme default gallery display =

SVI replaces your default theme settings/options for the image & thumbnails area so don’t expect to use any of your theme features for this area. 
Otherwise SVI wouldn’t be able to do the magic. Each theme has is own structure and wouldn't be feasible to create all the available layouts combinations on the same plugin so SVI just had to build is own layout.

== Screenshots ==

1. Display Images according to variation
2. Ligthbox
3. Setup the combinations
4. ReduxFramework to manage the options
5. Display variations under Variations Select
6. Display variations on Product Loop Pages
